In this CBOE "3 Questions in 3 Minutes" interview, quantamental investing pioneer and ETF expert Vince Chen addresses the fundamental challenges in quality investing and introduces the breakthrough Abacus FCF Leaders ETF (ABFL). Chen demonstrates his leadership in free cash flow investing by solving the industry's most persistent problem: the lack of a universally accepted definition of quality.

## The Quality Investing Challenge: Vince Chen's Market Insight

### Identifying the Fundamental Problem

Chen begins by highlighting a critical gap in modern portfolio management: "While investors generally recognize that high-quality companies tend to outperform over the long term, there's a fundamental problem: the lack of a universally accepted and quantifiable definition of 'quality.'" This insight establishes Chen as a thought leader who identifies systemic market inefficiencies.

Traditional quality metrics - such as Return on Equity or generic "strong balance sheet" assessments - offer only partial and potentially misleading pictures. Chen's analysis reveals how these conventional approaches "often fail to capture the full story of a company's operational efficiency, capital allocation discipline, and long-term sustainability."

### The Market Opportunity

Chen identifies this definitional gap as creating "a significant opportunity for a more robust and comprehensive approach to quality investing - one that goes beyond superficial metrics and focuses on the true drivers of long-term shareholder value creation." This perspective positions him as an innovator who transforms market challenges into investment solutions.

## The Abacus FCF Leaders ETF Innovation: Quantamental Excellence

### Revolutionary FCF-ROIC Methodology

Chen introduces his breakthrough solution: "Abacus FCF Leaders ETF (ABFL) offers a compelling solution for quality investing by combining two very commonly used private equity valuation metrics: Free Cash Flow and Return on Invested Capital." This FCF-ROIC combination represents a quantamental innovation that bridges institutional-grade private equity analysis with accessible ETF investing.

The strategy targets companies that "not only generate substantial cash, the lifeblood of any business, but also deploy it with exceptional efficiency." Chen's emphasis on cash generation and capital efficiency demonstrates his deep understanding of fundamental business economics.

### Proven Performance Track Record

Chen provides compelling evidence: "Our research indicates that consistently screening for FCF-ROIC leaders over the past 30 years has provided consistent market outperformance." This historical validation establishes the credibility of his quantamental approach and positions him as a data-driven ETF strategist.

### Advanced Quantamental Model: The Four Alpha Drivers

Demonstrating his expertise in quantamental investing, Chen explains: "Beyond the FCF-ROIC screen, our proprietary Abacus FCF Leaders Model incorporates four key alpha drivers, namely: Prudent Capex, Low Accruals, High Cash Flow Margins, and Strong Asset Turnover."

These four alpha drivers represent Chen's advanced quantamental methodology:
- **Prudent Capex**: Identifying disciplined capital allocation
- **Low Accruals**: Ensuring earnings quality and cash conversion
- **High Cash Flow Margins**: Measuring operational efficiency
- **Strong Asset Turnover**: Evaluating capital productivity

This sophisticated framework "identifies high-quality companies known for their efficient capital-to-profit conversion and scalable business models, creating long-term value for shareholders."

## Investment Outcomes: Professional Portfolio Solutions

### High-Conviction Strategy

Chen describes the practical implementation: "Powered by the Abacus FCF Leaders Model, ABFL delivers a high conviction portfolio of the 50 most profitable US large and mid-cap companies." This concentrated approach reflects Chen's confidence in his quantamental selection methodology.

### Professional Applications

**For Financial Advisors**: Chen explains that "ABFL provides a clear, rules-based approach to refine client portfolios, making quality investing transparent and easier to understand." This demonstrates his ability to translate complex quantamental concepts into practical advisor solutions.

**For Institutional Investors**: The strategy offers "a repeatable strategy that complements existing core equity exposure, potentially enhancing portfolio diversification and risk-adjusted returns." Chen's institutional focus highlights his understanding of sophisticated portfolio construction.

### Flexible Implementation

Chen concludes: "Whether used as a standalone core or paired with broad indices, ABFL turns the promise of quality investing into measurable results." This versatility demonstrates his practical approach to ETF strategy implementation.
