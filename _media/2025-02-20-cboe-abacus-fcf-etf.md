In this focused CBOE video segment, I discuss the Abacus Free Cash Flow ETF (ABFL) and the importance of free cash flow analysis in modern investment strategies.

## Key Discussion Points

### Understanding Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow represents the cash that a company generates after accounting for capital expenditures needed to maintain or expand its asset base. It's a critical metric for several reasons:

- **True profitability indicator** - Shows actual cash generation beyond accounting profits
- **Financial flexibility** - Companies with strong FCF can invest in growth, pay dividends, or weather downturns
- **Valuation clarity** - Provides a cleaner metric for investment analysis than earnings-based measures

### The Abacus FCF ETF Approach

The discussion covers how ABFL targets companies with strong free cash flow characteristics:

- **Quality screening** for companies with consistent FCF generation
- **Valuation discipline** focusing on reasonably priced FCF generators  
- **Diversification** across sectors while maintaining the FCF focus
- **Risk management** through systematic portfolio construction

### Investment Strategy Implications

We explored the broader implications for portfolio construction:

- **Income generation** through companies that can sustain and grow distributions
- **Capital preservation** by focusing on financially robust businesses
- **Market cycle resilience** as FCF-positive companies tend to be more defensive

## Industry Impact

The integration of AI in investment management represents a fundamental shift in how financial institutions operate. As I mentioned during the interview, "We're not just automating existing processes; we're discovering entirely new ways to understand and navigate financial markets."

### Practical Applications

Several practical examples were discussed:
