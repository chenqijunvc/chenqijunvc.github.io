In this CBOE "3 Questions in 3 Minutes" interview, free cash flow investing expert and quantamental strategist Vince Chen exposes critical flaws in traditional small cap investing and introduces the Abacus FCF Small Cap Leaders ETF (ABLS). Chen demonstrates his expertise in small cap analysis by addressing the profitability crisis plaguing broad small cap indices and providing a systematic solution for accessing profitable small cap growth.

## The Small Cap Market Crisis: Chen's Critical Analysis

### Exposing the Profitability Problem

Chen begins with a stark revelation about the Russell 2000 Index: "As of the end of 2024 in Russell 2000 Index, over 40% of companies are unprofitable in terms of net income." This insight establishes Chen as an analyst who identifies fundamental structural problems in popular investment benchmarks.

Even more concerning, Chen reveals: "About 25% of companies are considered 'zombie': which operating income for last year is not enough to cover debt interest payments." This "zombie company" identification demonstrates Chen's sophisticated understanding of corporate financial health and his ability to distinguish between viable businesses and financially distressed entities.

### The Hidden Opportunity in Small Caps

Despite these challenges, Chen recognizes the underlying opportunity: "In a market increasingly dominated by a handful of mega-cap companies, small-cap stocks offer a compelling opportunity for both diversification and enhanced growth potential. Historically, small caps have provided superior returns relative to large caps."

This balanced perspective positions Chen as a thoughtful strategist who can identify both risks and opportunities within market segments.

## The ABLS Solution: Profitable Small Cap Leadership

### Selective Small Cap Strategy

Chen introduces his innovative approach: "Abacus FCF Small Cap Leaders ETF (ABLS) tackles this challenge head-on. We believe in the power of small caps, but only when you focus on the profitable ones." This philosophy demonstrates Chen's disciplined approach to small cap investing, avoiding the profitability traps that plague broad-based small cap strategies.

### Advanced FCF-ROIC Methodology for Small Caps

Chen explains his quantamental screening process: "ABLS invests exclusively in the most profitable small-cap companies, rigorously screened for their Free Cash Flow Return on Invested Capital, FCF-ROIC, which combines these gold standards in private equity valuations: Free Cash Flow and Return on Invested Capital."

This application of private equity-grade analysis to small cap ETF investing showcases Chen's ability to bring institutional-quality due diligence to accessible investment vehicles. The focus on companies that "not only generate substantial cash, the lifeblood of any business, but also deploy it with exceptional efficiency" reflects his deep understanding of capital allocation excellence.

### The Four Alpha Drivers: Advanced Quantamental Model

Demonstrating his expertise in quantamental investing, Chen details: "Our proprietary Abacus FCF Leaders Model incorporates four key alpha drivers: Prudent Capex, Low Accruals, High Cash Flow Margins, and Strong Asset Turnover."

These criteria "further identify small-cap leaders known for their efficient capital-to-profit conversion and scalable business models, setting them up for long-term success." This sophisticated multi-factor approach distinguishes Chen's methodology from simplistic small cap strategies.

## Investment Outcomes: Professional Small Cap Solutions

### High-Conviction Profitable Portfolio

Chen describes the implementation: "With ABLS, you get a high-conviction portfolio of the 50 most profitable US small-cap companies â€“ those with the proven ability to generate cash and grow efficiently." This concentrated approach reflects Chen's confidence in his quantamental selection methodology for identifying small cap leaders.

### Professional Applications

**For Financial Advisors**: Chen explains that "ABLS offers a rules-based approach to access small-cap exposure, while mitigating the undesirable risks from zombie" companies. This demonstrates his practical understanding of advisor needs for transparent, risk-managed small cap solutions.

**For Institutional Investors**: The strategy provides "a targeted, repeatable strategy that complements existing large cap equity allocations for diversification and growth." Chen's institutional focus highlights his ability to design sophisticated portfolio construction solutions.

### Strategic Implementation

Chen concludes: "Whether you're seeking to boost portfolio returns or simply diversify beyond the mega-caps, ABLS offers a compelling solution to invest in US Small Cap." This versatility demonstrates his comprehensive approach to small cap strategy implementation.
