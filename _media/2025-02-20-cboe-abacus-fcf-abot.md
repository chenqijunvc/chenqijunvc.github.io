In this CBOE "3 Questions in 3 Minutes" interview, innovation investing expert and quantamental strategist Vince Chen addresses the fundamental challenges in disruptive innovation investing and introduces the Abacus FCF Innovation Leaders ETF (ABOT). Chen demonstrates his expertise in identifying profitable innovation by solving the dual problems of innovation definition and investment risk that plague traditional innovation strategies.

## The Innovation Investing Challenge: Chen's Market Analysis

### Identifying the Dual Innovation Problem

Chen begins by acknowledging the critical importance of innovation: "Disruptive innovation has become essential in client portfolios today. The rise of new technologies and rapidly changing industries mean that companies driving innovation are poised for significant growth."

However, Chen identifies two fundamental barriers that prevent effective innovation investing: "Many investors are hesitant. Why? First, the risk is perceived to be high - many innovative ventures fail. Second, there's the problem of definition - what really is 'innovation'? Is it just hype?"

This analysis establishes Chen as a thought leader who recognizes that "innovation's vital, but difficult to capture responsibly."

### The Market Opportunity

Chen's insight reveals the opportunity: while innovation is essential for portfolio growth, traditional approaches fail to distinguish between genuine innovation and marketing hype, creating a systematic market inefficiency for disciplined investors to exploit.

## The ABOT Innovation: Profitable Innovation Methodology

### Systematic Innovation Identification

Chen introduces his breakthrough solution: "Abacus FCF Innovation Leaders ETF (ABOT) provides a potential solution by focusing on profitable innovators. We start by identifying innovators based on transparent Research & Development (R&D) intensity metrics – we're looking for companies truly committed to groundbreaking research."

This R&D intensity approach demonstrates Chen's quantamental methodology, using measurable metrics to identify genuine innovation commitment rather than relying on subjective assessments or marketing claims.

### The Quality Innovation Standard

Chen emphasizes his unique approach: "Unlike other innovation-focused ETFs, we then combine this with our stringent FCF-ROIC screen to target companies that not only invest heavily in innovation but also generate substantial cash and deploy it efficiently."

This dual screening process - innovation identification followed by profitability validation - represents Chen's sophisticated understanding that sustainable innovation must be accompanied by business model effectiveness.

### The Cash Flow Innovation Philosophy

Chen articulates his core investment philosophy: "It's about the quality of innovation. Too often, investors just throw money at companies who say they are innovative, we say it isn't enough. It's got to be about turning that innovation into cash flow. That's what makes ABOT different."

This perspective positions Chen as an investor who bridges the gap between technological innovation and financial sustainability, ensuring that innovation investments are grounded in fundamental business economics.

## Investment Outcomes: Profitable Innovation Solutions

### High-Conviction Innovation Portfolio

Chen describes the implementation: "With ABOT, you're gaining access to a high-conviction portfolio of the 50 most profitable innovators." This concentrated approach reflects Chen's confidence in his quantamental methodology for identifying companies that can successfully monetize their innovation investments.

### Strategic Investment Benefits

Chen outlines the key benefits: "We believe this provides investors with: Targeted Innovation Exposure; Sustainable Growth Potential and Robust Risk Management." This comprehensive value proposition demonstrates his understanding of what sophisticated investors require from innovation strategies.

### Professional Applications

**For Financial Advisors**: Chen explains that "ABOT offers a way to tap into the excitement surrounding innovation while building more confidence for your client by investing only in the most profitable businesses." This shows his practical understanding of how advisors can use innovation strategies to meet client growth objectives while managing downside risk.

**For Institutional Investors**: The strategy provides "a strategic investment for capitalizing disruptions with proven business models." Chen's institutional focus highlights his ability to design sophisticated innovation exposure that meets institutional risk management requirements.

### Flexible Implementation Strategy

Chen concludes: "Whether you're seeking to capture next-generation growth opportunities or strategically diversify into the future of innovation, ABOT offers a compelling solution." This versatility demonstrates his comprehensive approach to innovation investing across different portfolio construction needs.

## The Innovation Investing Evolution: From Hype to Profitability

Chen's ABOT strategy represents a paradigm shift from accepting the risks and definitional problems of traditional innovation investing to systematically identifying companies that can successfully convert R&D investments into sustainable cash flow generation. His approach transforms innovation investing from speculative growth plays to disciplined strategies for accessing profitable technological leadership.

## Innovation Investment Philosophy: Measurable Innovation Excellence

Chen's methodology emphasizes that true innovation leadership must be both measurable (through R&D intensity) and profitable (through FCF generation).
