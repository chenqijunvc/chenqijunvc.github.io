### General Characteristics

Before diving into performance, understanding a strategy's fundamental operational characteristics is paramount. These descriptive metrics provide context for its behavior and scalability:

* **Time Range:** The historical period over which the strategy has been simulated or observed.
* **Average AUM (Assets Under Management):** The typical capital size the strategy manages, providing insight into its scale.
* **Capacity:** The maximum AUM the strategy can effectively manage before its alpha may degrade due to market impact or liquidity constraints.
* **Leverage:** The degree to which borrowed capital is used to amplify returns, indicating potential risk magnification.
* **Maximum Dollar Position:** The largest absolute capital allocation to any single asset at a given time.
* **Ratio of Longs:** The proportion of long positions relative to total positions (longs + shorts), indicating directional bias.
* **Frequency of Bets:** How often the strategy initiates new positions or makes investment decisions (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
* **Average Holding Period:** The typical duration for which assets are held within the portfolio.
* **Annualized Turnover:** A measure of trading activity, representing the total value of assets bought or sold over a year, relative to AUM.
* **Correlation to Underlying:** The correlation of the strategy's returns to its target market or a broad market index, indicating systemic exposure.

### Performance Metrics

These metrics quantify the financial outcomes generated by the strategy:

* **PnL (Profit and Loss):** The absolute gain or loss over a period.
* **PnL from Long Positions:** The profit or loss specifically attributable to long positions, useful for dissecting performance sources.
* **Annualized Rate of Return (Arithmetic/Geometric):** The average return generated per year, often calculated using both arithmetic and time-weighted (geometric) methods for different insights.
* **Time-Weighted Rate of Return:** A geometric average that eliminates the effects of capital inflows/outflows, providing a true measure of investment compounding.
* **Average Return from Hits:** The average profit from winning trades.
* **Average Return from Misses:** The average loss from losing trades.

### Run Statistics and Concentration

Beyond simple aggregates, understanding the pattern and concentration of returns is vital for assessing robustness and potential vulnerabilities:

* **Returns Concentration:**
    * **High Sharpe Ratio (often a goal):** While a desired outcome, a high Sharpe must be investigated for its underlying drivers.
    * **High Number of Bets per Year:** Indicates diversification across opportunities.
    * **High Hit Ratio:** The percentage of winning trades.
    * **No Fat Tail:** Implies that extreme negative returns are not disproportionately frequent or severe.
    * **Bets are not Concentrated in Time:** Avoids over-reliance on specific periods, reducing time-series specific risk.
* **Drawdown and Time Under Water:**
    * **Drawdown:** The peak-to-trough decline in value during a specific period.
    * **Time Under Water (TuW):** The duration from the start of a drawdown until the previous peak is recovered.
* **Runs Statistics for Performance Evaluation:** These use statistical measures, often related to the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), to assess concentration:
    * **HHI index on positive returns:** Measures the concentration of profits in a few large winning trades.
    * **HHI index on negative returns:** Measures the concentration of losses in a few large losing trades.
    * **HHI index on time between bets:** Assesses if trades are clustered or evenly distributed over time.
    * **95-percentile DD:** The drawdown level that is worse than 95% of observed drawdowns, indicating extreme downside risk.
    * **95-percentile TuW:** The time under water duration that is longer than 95% of observed periods, indicating extreme recovery times.

### Implementation Shortfall

These metrics quantify the costs and friction associated with executing a strategy in a live environment, comparing ideal performance to real-world outcomes:

* **Broker Fees per Turnover:** Direct costs paid to brokers relative to trading volume.
* **Average Slippage per Turnover:** The difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price executed, normalized by trading volume.
* **Dollar Performance per Turnover:** The profit or loss generated per dollar of assets traded, considering all execution costs.
* **Return on Execution Costs:** A measure of how much return is generated for every unit of execution cost incurred.

### Efficiency Metrics

Efficiency metrics evaluate the quality of risk-adjusted returns, providing a standardized way to compare strategies:

* **Sharpe Ratio:** Active return per unit of total risk (standard deviation of returns).
* **Probabilistic Sharpe Ratio (PSR):** A statistically robust version of the Sharpe Ratio that accounts for the number of trials and potential data mining, giving the probability that a strategy's observed Sharpe Ratio is truly positive or above a certain threshold.
* **Deflated Sharpe Ratio (DSR):** Another advanced metric that adjusts the Sharpe Ratio for the impact of backtest overfitting, providing a more conservative and realistic estimate of out-of-sample performance.
* **Information Ratio:** Active return per unit of active risk (tracking error).

### Classification Score (for ML-driven strategies)

For strategies employing machine learning classifiers, these metrics assess the performance of the prediction model itself:

* **Accuracy:** The proportion of correct predictions (both true positives and true negatives).
* **Precision:** Of all positive predictions, what proportion were actually correct (minimizes false positives).
* **Recall:** Of all actual positive cases, what proportion were correctly identified (minimizes false negatives).
* **F1 Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure.
* **Negative Log-Loss:** A measure of prediction uncertainty and classification quality, penalizing confident wrong predictions more heavily.

### Attribution

Attribution analysis dissects portfolio returns into components explained by specific factors (e.g., industry, style, country) and a residual, active component:

* **Barra's Multi-Factor Model:** A widely used framework for attributing portfolio returns to systematic risk factors and manager-specific alpha, providing detailed insights into the sources of performance.

### Risk Metrics

Comprehensive risk assessment goes beyond volatility to encompass benchmark-relative risk, capital preservation, and tail risk:

#### Volatility Risk
* **Standard Deviation:** The most common measure of total risk, quantifying the dispersion of returns around the mean.
* **Downside Deviation:** Measures only the volatility of negative returns, focusing on downside risk.
* **Sharpe Ratio:** As above, risk-adjusted return using total risk.
* **Sortino Ratio:** Risk-adjusted return using downside deviation, preferred for focusing on undesirable volatility.

#### Benchmark Risk
* **Excess Return:** The difference between the portfolio return and the benchmark return.
* **Batting Average:** The proportion of periods where the portfolio outperformed its benchmark.
* **Up Capture:** Measures how well the portfolio performs relative to the benchmark during periods of positive benchmark returns.
* **Down Capture:** Measures how much the portfolio declines relative to the benchmark during periods of negative benchmark returns.
* **Alpha:** The residual return not explained by systematic market risk, often derived from regression models (e.g., CAPM).
* **Beta:** A measure of a portfolio's systematic risk, indicating its sensitivity to benchmark movements.
* **R-squared:** The proportion of the portfolio's variance explained by the benchmark, indicating goodness of fit for regression models.
* **Tracking Error:** The standard deviation of the portfolio's active returns (excess returns relative to the benchmark), representing active risk.
* **Treynor Ratio:** Excess return per unit of systematic risk (Beta), useful for diversified portfolios.
* **Information Ratio:** As above, active return per unit of active risk.
* **M-squared (Modigliani-Modigliani Measure):** A risk-adjusted return measure that scales the portfolio's returns to have the same total risk as the market, allowing direct comparison with the market return.

#### Capital Preservation Risk
* **Maximum Drawdown:** The largest peak-to-trough decline in the portfolio's value over a specified period, representing potential capital loss.
* **Pain Ratio (Pain Index):** A more nuanced measure of drawdown, accounting for both the magnitude and duration of losses.
* **Calmar Ratio:** Annualized return divided by maximum drawdown, offering a quick risk-adjusted return metric focused on capital preservation.

#### Tail Risk
* **Skewness:** Measures the asymmetry of the return distribution. Negative skewness indicates a higher probability of large negative returns.
* **Kurtosis:** Measures the "tailedness" of the return distribution. High kurtosis (leptokurtic distribution) indicates more frequent extreme events (both positive and negative) than a normal distribution.
* **Omega Ratio:** A risk-adjusted return measure that considers the entire return distribution, focusing on the likelihood of achieving returns above a minimum acceptable threshold.
* **VaR (Value-at-Risk):** A statistical measure of the maximum potential loss that a portfolio could incur over a given time horizon with a specified probability (e.g., 99% VaR over 1 day).
* **CVaR (Conditional Value-at-Risk) / Expected Shortfall:** The expected loss given that the loss exceeds the VaR, providing a more robust measure of tail risk than VaR alone.
