# chenqijunvc.github.io: Exploring AI, Data, and Finance

Welcome to my personal blog, `chenqijunvc.github.io`! This space is dedicated to exploring the fascinating intersections of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **data science**, and **capital markets**. With nearly a decade of experience in quantitative finance, I aim to share insights, analyses, and my journey in applying cutting-edge technologies to the world of investments.

This blog is powered by **Clean Blog Jekyll**, a stylish and responsive blog theme from Start Bootstrap. It provides the perfect framework to present my thoughts and research in a clear and engaging manner.
